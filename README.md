# Golden Gate Bridge Scene

This project renders an interactive Golden Gate Bridge scene in the browser. Use the included HTML to view the experience locally.

## Test with GitHub Pages

1. Push the repository to GitHub if it is not already there.
2. In the repository settings, open **Pages** and choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Select the default branch (for example `main`) and the **/(root)** folder, then save.
4. Wait for the GitHub Pages deployment workflow to finish (check the Actions tab if you want progress).
5. Open the published URL shown in the Pages settings (it will look like `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`) to exercise `index.html` in the browser.
6. If the site loads a blank white page, make sure the URL includes the repository segment (for example `https://<username>.github.io/golden-gate-bridge/`) and allow a few minutes for the deployment to finish. GitHub Pages sometimes serves `404.html` before the build completes; refresh after a minute if you see a redirect notice.
7. Push new commits whenever you want Pages to rebuild and retest the scene.
